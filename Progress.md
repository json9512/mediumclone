# Set of features to implement

This will not be a feature for feature clone of the Medium web app.

I expect this to be a minimal version of Medium that supports the following:

1. OAuth2 for user authentication
2. Trending stories in mediumclone (based on number of times visited)
3. user can only post if they are authenticated (Need editor)
4. user can like post (only when they are logged in)
5. user can comment post (only when they are logged in)
