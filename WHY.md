# Why ?
Lists things I learnt, decisions I made throughout the project.

# Learnt

- Learnt how to set up basic CI/CD pipeline with Appveyor, Travis, and coverall through this [tutorial](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/04/express-api-backend-project-postgresql/#top)

- Learnt a bit more about web and helmet such as managing CSPs, http headers, etc by utilizing helmet middlewares on express.

- Learnt the chaos of server-side-rendered (~~dynamic...~~) static web pages with template engines. Learnt the tidiness of frontend frameworks like React, Vue.

- Learnt how to compile files with webpack

- Learnt async IIFE 

- Learnt how to create basic read/write editor with ProseMirror

# Why

- PUG - I've used PUG with one of my uni assignments. The experience I had was not bad, so I decided to use it here. (~~I was kind of tired of using React~~) <br>Besides, I wanted to experience server-side-rendering and not having to fire up a separate frontend app. Crucially, I assumed the project would be simple enough to build with PUG.

- express, nodejs - django and python came to my mind first. However, I assumed (again) that the project was simple enough and the quick setup with express/nodejs was the go to.

- Postgresql - I did consider alternatives such as MySQL, MongoDB, cloud databases. However, I chose to stick with psql because I had prior experience and I wanted to learn more about the SQL language.

- ProseMirror - This was the suggested opensource tool for editors by a Medium developer. I've had experience with react-wysiwyg before but I struggled customizing it. <br>Whereas, ProseMirror was great for customizing the editor. But I ended up using the simple example they provided.
